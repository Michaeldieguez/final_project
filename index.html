      <p>My website is on some of my favorite youtube's in the FaZe Clan. Some of my favorite FaZe members live in the FaZe House here in L.A. which they just moved to. But some live in their own home like FaZe Rug. The guys that live in the FaZe house are called FaZe Apex, FaZe Rain, FaZe Adapt, FaZe Teecho, FaZe Blaziken, and FaZe Temperrr. There is also one FaZe member that lives in the house which is FaZe Cheo which is the cook in the FaZe House. My other favorite youtuber's that don't live in the house is FaZe Rug, FaZe Nikan, and FaZe Censor. FaZe Clan is a huge gaming industry that play videogames but some FaZe members are vloggers. </p>
